Notes:

- There are two web2py applications inside of this application which you can download.

- The first is a client application to display the functionality of the web services which I implemented for this app.
    - To Download, start this app with web2py and navigate to the location: http://127.0.0.1:8000/tracker/static/file/web2py.app.TrackerTests.w2p
        * Inside of the client is a standalone Python program that can be used to test the xmlrpc functionality as well. (static file inside of TrackerTests.w2p)

- The second is a testing suite application to test the functionality of the Project Tracker App.
    - To Download, start this app with web2py and navigate to the location: http://127.0.0.1:8000/tracker/static/file/web2py.app.TrackerClient.w2p
        * Inside of the testing app is a standalone Python program that can also be used to run functional tests using seleniums webdriver. (static file inside of TrackerClient.w2p)

- There are also a number of testing users already setup, all with the same 'test' password.
